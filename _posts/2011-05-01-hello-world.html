<p>I go by seglo.  This is my first experimental posting in the blog-o-sphere.  I want to use this space as a medium for me to express my thoughts on subjects relating to software development, technology, and occasionally an opinion I feel might be of interest to someone other than myself.  If you disagree with something I've written then please challenge me!  I’m a man of few words and have always held the belief that if you don’t have something of value to add to a conversation then there’s no sense in saying it.  With that in mind I’ll try to keep my posts meaningful and concise.  Let the experiment begin.</p>
