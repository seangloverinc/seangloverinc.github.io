<p>I'm an experienced software development technical leader and skilled software developer. I'm a strategic thinker, highly organized and goal orientated. I regularly keep up-to-date of industry standard development practices through discussion, training, books, newsgroups, blogs and self-study. I'm experienced in software design & architecture using Domain Driven Design methodologies and enterprise design patterns.</p>
<p>I have extensive experience designing enterprise level software in the Master Data Management (MDM), Financial Performance Management (FPM/CPM), and Customer Experience Management (CEM) spaces.</p>
<p>I want to continue to improve my skills both as a software developer and technical leader. </p>
